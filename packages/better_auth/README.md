## About the Project

Better Auth Ruby is a comprehensive authentication and authorization library for Ruby. It provides a complete set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code.

### Features

- **Framework Agnostic Core**: Works with any Rack-based application
- **Rails Integration**: First-class Rails support with middleware and helpers
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Email/password, OAuth, JWT, and more
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP and WebAuthn support
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'better_auth'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install better_auth
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```ruby
require 'better_auth'

auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  database: :memory
)
```

### Password Hashing

Better Auth Ruby uses upstream-compatible `scrypt` password hashes by default through Ruby's `OpenSSL::KDF.scrypt`, so no extra password-hashing gem is required for the default setup.

```ruby
auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  password_hasher: :scrypt # default
)
```

Applications that prefer Ruby's familiar BCrypt ecosystem can opt in by adding `gem "bcrypt"` and configuring:

```ruby
auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  password_hasher: :bcrypt
)
```

Custom Better Auth-style password callbacks are still supported through `email_and_password[:password][:hash]` and `[:verify]`.

### Database Adapters

The core gem ships framework-agnostic adapters for memory, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. Driver gems are loaded only when their adapter is instantiated. MongoDB support lives in the external `better_auth-mongo-adapter` package so apps that do not use MongoDB do not install the Mongo driver.

```ruby
auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  database: BetterAuth::Adapters::SQLite.new(path: "storage/auth.sqlite3")
)
```

```ruby
require "better_auth/mongo_adapter"

auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  database: BetterAuth::Adapters::MongoDB.new(
    database: mongo_client.database,
    client: mongo_client,
    transaction: false
  )
)
```

```ruby
auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  database: BetterAuth::Adapters::MSSQL.new(url: ENV.fetch("DATABASE_URL"))
)
```

### Social Providers

```ruby
require "better_auth"

auth = BetterAuth.auth(
  secret: ENV.fetch("BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"),
  social_providers: {
    google: BetterAuth::SocialProviders.google(
      client_id: ENV.fetch("GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"),
      client_secret: ENV.fetch("GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET")
    ),
    github: BetterAuth::SocialProviders.github(
      client_id: ENV.fetch("GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"),
      client_secret: ENV.fetch("GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET")
    )
  }
)
```

### JavaScript Client

Ruby Better Auth exposes the same HTTP route surface. Frontend apps should use the upstream Better Auth JavaScript client and point it at the Ruby server:

```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
  basePath: "/api/auth",
});
```

### Rails Integration

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "better_auth-rails"
```

Then in your ApplicationController:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include BetterAuth::Rails::ControllerHelpers
end
```

Now you have access to `current_user` and authentication methods:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_authentication

  def index
    @posts = current_user.posts
  end
end
```

## Development

Full documentation is being adapted in the root [`docs/`](/Users/sebastiansala/projects/better-auth/docs/README.md) app. Start with the Ruby-first installation, basic usage, Rack, Rails, PostgreSQL, and MySQL pages there; pages with a Ruby port warning still contain upstream TypeScript examples for reference.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sebasxsala/better-auth.git
cd better-auth/packages/better_auth

# 2. Install dependencies
make install
# or: bundle install

# 3. Run tests to verify everything works
make ci
```

### Common Make Commands

We use a **Makefile** to simplify commands. All have explanatory comments:

```bash
# View all available commands with description
make help

# Development
make console          # Interactive console with gem loaded
make lint            # Check code style
make lint-fix        # Auto-fix style issues

# Testing
make test            # Run all tests
make test-core       # Only core tests (Minitest)
make test-coverage   # Tests with coverage
make ci              # Full CI (lint + test)

# Databases for testing
make db-up           # Start PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MSSQL, Redis
make db-down         # Stop containers
```

### Branch Workflow

This project uses a branch model similar to the upstream:

**Main Branches:**

- **`main`**: Stable code, ready for production
- **`canary`**: Development/integration branch (like "development" but specific name)
  - "Canary" comes from "canary in a coal mine" - where changes are tested before production
  - Feature PRs go to `canary`
  - When `canary` is stable, merge to `main` for release

**Typical workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create your feature branch from canary
git checkout canary
git pull origin canary
git checkout -b feat/new-feature

# 2. Make your changes and commits
# ... code ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat(core): add support for X"

# 3. Push and create PR towards canary
git push origin feat/new-feature
# Create PR on GitHub towards canary

# 4. Once merged to canary and tested,
#    merge canary → main for release
```

**Why canary instead of development?**

- Common name in projects with frequent releases
- Suggests it's an "experimental" version that might break
- Allows multiple levels: feature → canary → main

### How CI/CD Works

**Pull Requests:**
- Each PR runs: lint + tests on Ruby 3.2 and 3.3
- Everything must pass before merging

**Automatic Release (GitHub Actions):**

Release is triggered by package-prefixed tags so each gem can ship independently.

```bash
# STEP 1: Update the target package version file
# Example: VERSION = "0.1.1"

# STEP 2: Commit and push to main
git add lib/better_auth/version.rb
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.1"
git push origin main

# STEP 3: Create the tag for the gem you want to publish
git tag better_auth-v0.1.1
git push origin better_auth-v0.1.1

# STEP 4: GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Runs tests
# - Builds the gem
# - Publishes to RubyGems (if version is new)
# - Creates GitHub Release
```

Use `better_auth-vX.Y.Z` for the core gem, `better_auth-rails-vX.Y.Z` for Rails, `better_auth-sinatra-vX.Y.Z` for Sinatra, and `better_auth-hanami-vX.Y.Z` for Hanami.

**Required GitHub Configuration:**

1. In RubyGems, configure Trusted Publishing for each gem that should publish from CI.
2. Use this repository and workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
3. The workflow exchanges GitHub's OIDC token for short-lived RubyGems credentials when the matching package tag is pushed.

**Dry-run options:**

```bash
# Local packaging dry-run
make release-check

# CI dry-run from GitHub Actions
# Actions -> Release -> Run workflow -> dry_run=true
```

### Manual Release (without GitHub Actions)

Only if you need to do a manual release:

```bash
# 1. Update version.rb
# 2. Build the gem
gem build better_auth.gemspec

# 3. Publish (you need to be logged into RubyGems)
gem push better_auth-*.gem

# 4. Create and push the tag
git tag -a better_auth-v0.1.1 -m "Release better_auth v0.1.1"
git push origin better_auth-v0.1.1
```

### Project Structure

```
lib/
  better_auth.rb              # Entry point
  better_auth/
    version.rb                # Gem version
    core.rb                   # Core loader
    core/                     # Core logic (framework-agnostic)

test/                       # Core tests (Minitest)
```

**Conventions:**
- Core: Framework-agnostic, uses Minitest
- All code goes through StandardRB (Ruby style guide)
