# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed auth dispatch when Rack splits mounted paths across `SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO`.
- Rejected `better_auth at: "/"` to avoid capturing every Sinatra route.
- Stopped swallowing real migration bookkeeping query errors while preserving empty-state behavior for missing schema tables.
- Split simple single-line multi-statement SQL migration files.
- Passed versioned `secrets` through Sinatra configuration to core auth.
- Warned when `better_auth` is configured more than once on the same Sinatra app class.
- Returned JSON-shaped 401 responses from `require_authentication` when JSON is preferred.
- Removed duplicate Rake task wiring and clarified `better_auth:routes` output.
- Documented mount path, Rack nesting, SQL migration, and helper auth caveats.
